# Research Attachment Hub v1.0.3 Release Notes

## 🎉 Version Highlights

This update primarily fixes the MD file binding functionality that was not working and adds intelligent status validation features, greatly improving user experience and functionality stability.

## 🔧 Major Fixes

### 1. Fixed MD File Binding Functionality
- **Issue**: Clicking MD file status icons (✗) in table view, card view, and preview view had no response
- **Fix**: Added complete click event handling for all views
- **Impact**: Users can now normally click to create MD files

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Issue**: Multiple TypeScript type errors during build
- **Fix**:
  - Added `'embed'` type to `ReferenceInfo` interface
  - Fixed Obsidian API method call compatibility issues
  - Changed `updateStatusBar` method to public access
- **Impact**: More stable build process

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Intelligent MD File Status Validation
- **Function**: Automatically checks if MD files actually exist
- **Smart Handling**:
  - Auto-updates status when showing "exists" but file doesn't actually exist
  - Auto-creates when showing "doesn't exist" but should exist
- **Method**: `validateAndUpdateMDFileStatus()`

### 2. MD File Creation Confirmation Modal
- **Component**: New `CreateMDFileModal.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Shows detailed attachment information (title, author, year, DOI)
  - Shows complete path where MD file will be created
  - Shows different warning messages based on file existence
  - Only creates file after user confirmation

### 3. Batch Status Validation
- **Function**: Right-click menu now includes "Validate MD File Status" option
- **Purpose**: Validate all records' MD file status at once
- **Result**: Automatically updates inconsistent statuses and refreshes view

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Debug Info**: Added detailed console log output
- **Status Hints**: Mouse hover shows "Click to create MD file" tooltip
- **Event Handling**: Added `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to prevent event conflicts
